# SelfConceptExploration
This is my final project for PSYC-E1557, a psychology course on self and identity.
It is an agent-based model where each agent seeks to maximize their self-esteem by adopting and removing self concepts,
adding and removing neighbors, and changing themselves. It features ideas from many different theoretical frameworks,
including self-knowledge accuracy motive, self-enhancement theory, selective assosciation, group comparision,
group appraisal, social valuation/devaluation, self-concept differentiation, self-complexity, self-determination theory,
sociometer theory, social identity, group identity, personal identity, and social networks.

Use the .alp file to open the model in AnyLogic.

Download and decompress the .7z model to run the model as a standalone application.
